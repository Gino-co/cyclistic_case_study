# Cyclistic Case Study – Google Data Analytics Certificate

This repository contains the final project for the **Google Data Analytics Certificate**, completed entirely in **R**. It analyzes Cyclistic dataset from raw data to the final RMarkdown report.

---

## Repository Structure

- `data/raw/` – Sample raw data files.  
- Contains only a few CSV examples and a README explaining how to obtain the full dataset.  
- `data/processed/` – Processed data generated by the scripts.  
- `scripts/` – R scripts for data cleaning, summaries, and exploratory analysis.  
- `reports/` – Final RMarkdown report of the project.  
- `.gitignore` – Ignores generated and large files.

## How to Reproduce the Analysis

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gino-co/cyclistic_case_study.git
```

2. Open the R project:

```bash
cd cyclistic_case_study
open cyclistic_case_study.Rproj
```

3. Run the scripts in order:

- scripts/01_clean.R – Clean and preprocess raw data.

- scripts/02_summary.R – Summarize and transform data.

- scripts/03_eda.R – Exploratory data analysis.

4. Render the final report in reports/cyclistic_case_study.Rmd to generate HTML, PDF, or Word outputs.

## Notes

Only sample raw data is included due to file size restrictions. Refer to data/raw/README.md for instructions to download the full dataset.

All outputs can be regenerated from the scripts and raw data.
